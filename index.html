    <h1 id="king">King of the Hill</h1>
    <p>
        King of the Hill is an American animated sitcom created by Mike Judge and Greg Daniels for the Fox Broadcasting Company that ran from January 12, 1997, to May 6, 2010. 
        It centers on the Hills, a middle-class American family in the fictional city of Arlen, Texas. 
        Patriarch and main character Hank Hill, who works as assistant manager at Strickland Propane, is the everyman and general protagonist of the series. 
        Hank is friends with other residents on his block, especially Bill Dauterive, Dale Gribble, and Jeff Boomhauer, all of whom he has known since elementary school. 
        The show attempts to maintain a realistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life.

        <li>
            Conception:
            In early 1995, after the successful first run of Beavis and Butt-Head on MTV, Mike Judge decided to create another animated series, this one set in a small Texas town based on an amalgamation of Dallas suburbs, including Garland, Texas, where he had lived, and Richardson.
            Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote a pilot script.
        </li>
        <li>
            Initial success:
            After its debut, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including Entertainment Weekly, Time, and TV Guide.
            For the 1997â€“1998 season, the series became one of Fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed The Simpsons in ratings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Format change:
            Judge and Daniels' reduced involvement with the show resulted in the series' format turning more episodic and formulaic.
            Beginning in season seven, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky, who had worked on the series since season two, took it over completely, tending to emphasize Judge's concept that the series was built around sociopolitical humor rather than character-driven humor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cancellation:
            Although ratings remained consistent throughout the 10th, 11th and 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall Nielsen ratings (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 that King of the Hill had been cancelled.
